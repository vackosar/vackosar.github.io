I am a ML engineer at [GLAMI, a fashion search engine](https://glami.group/) which connects customers online to e-shops, where I develop a system that each month processes around 40 million detections of product features. We publish resources which you for machine learning research and education. For example, we recently published this dataset and a [Colab notebook where you can play with out product catalog combining of texts which are in multiple languages and images](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16gMqVqUpleacU5z9Y_7f3c-7I0C45esy?usp=sharing). You easily [classify products using image and text](/ml/Multimodal-Image-Text-Classification), and you can find similar products just using images and so on.
