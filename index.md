I reduce costs and increase revenues with software and machine learning systems. For [GLAMI](https://medium.com/@glami-engineering), I am optimizing a product feature detection system performing 40 million predictions (e.g. [product category](/software/google-product-taxonomy-viewer)) each month, so that the customers can find what they are looking for quickly. I also publish resources which you for machine learning research and education. For example, with GLAMI we recently published a [GLAMI-1M dataset](https://github.com/glami/glami-1m) together with a [practise notebook combining of texts which are in multiple languages and images](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16gMqVqUpleacU5z9Y_7f3c-7I0C45esy?usp=sharing).
