- replaces the input vector with a vector from a codebook" - a finite set of vectors called 
- forward pass selects single quantization vector
- backward pass uses Gumbal softmax over the codebook
- product quantization:
  - concatenation of several quantizations
  - then linear transformation
- used in [Wav2vec](/ml/Wav2vec2-Semi-and-Unsupervised-Speech-Recognition#quantization) and [DALL-E 1 and VQ-VAE](/ml/openai-dall-e-2-and-dall-e-1) and is related to [tokenization](/ml/Tokenization-in-Machine-Learning-Explained)
