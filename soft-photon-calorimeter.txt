To understand photon production and it’s importance for collective phenomena explanations.
To get familiar with GEANT, PYTHIA, PAW
To simulate the spectra of photons produced in high energy collisions
To understand how a electromagnetic calorimeter works.
To simulate the energy deposition spectra of photons in a calorimeter.

Isotropical with energy distribution:
- capability to measure low energy deposit E < 5 MeV
- the dimension of one cell 4 x 4 x 120 cm 3
- localization of photon σ < 2 cm.


Red - BGO crystals
Blue - organic scintillator - cutting the charged particles
Green - Veto - energy leakages

From GEANT 50 GeV

In spite of small dimension of detector it allows one to detect low energy photons with small background contribution from high energy particles.

This is achieved due to VETO detector and measurement of location of incoming photons.

Signal of soft photons is detectable for cross section of several mb, according to the simulation.

Generate total momentum of photons in CMS
Generate the direction of photons in CMS
