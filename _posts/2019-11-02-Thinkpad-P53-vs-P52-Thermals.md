I have been having minor thermal issues with my Thinkpad P53 that I decided to buy and share information about in [my review of Lenovo P52 compared to Dell Precision 7530](https://vaclavkosar.com/2019/03/03/Thinkpad-P52-vs-HP-Zbook-15-G5-vs-Dell-Precision-7530.html). Specifically I had "dmesg" command print messages about "package temperature above threshold" indicating that CPU is being throttled.

In general people complain about bad thermal design on latest Thinkpad including P52 e.g. [single heatpipe](http://forum.notebookreview.com/attachments/cooling_comparison-png.160125/), [prolonged cinebench performance dropoff](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-P52-i7-P1000-FHD-Workstation-Review.322974.0.html).

Had this improved with Thinkpad P53?

## Verdict

I am no expert, but no significant change appears to have occurred. On top of that P53 also newly has no removable battery. Unfortunately I will likely have to find another brand.
Read or watch [my review of Lenovo P52 compared to Dell Precision 7530 from personal experience](https://vaclavkosar.com/2019/03/03/Thinkpad-P52-vs-HP-Zbook-15-G5-vs-Dell-Precision-7530.html).
What I also love about P52 is graphics card, I can [train neural networks like DistilBERT](/ml/transformers-self-attention-mechanism-simplified) on my local machine.
But for anything bigger use cloud and for that you can use [Kubernetes wrappers like BentoML, Cortex, or Helm](/ml/BentoML-vs-Cortex.dev-ML-Serving-Showdown)
