Richard Hamming's Lectures are amazingly inspirational to the point that [Sam Altman](http://blog.samaltman.com/you-and-your-research) and [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html) written posts on one of them called You And Your Research.
While You can play them via [a Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD4b-52jtos&list=PL2FF649D0C4407B30&index=1), you can save some bandwidth in exchange for recording quality by using high compression of [Speex](https://www.speex.org/) codec.
You can find ["Spxfy" script here and similar things in that repo.](https://github.com/vackosar/text2gsm/blob/master/spxfy).
I like to compress videos to be able to archive in [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) and to save mobile bandwidth.
In particular, I recommend "You and Your Research" lecture.
