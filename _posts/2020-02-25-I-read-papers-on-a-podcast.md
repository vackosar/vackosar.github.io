And it does work.
I think I am able to speak faster and with more precision than I did before I started.
Unfortunately my voice is still not so pleasant to listen and I do still slur words.
Furthermore I read much more papers than before.
Also, I at least some people like the content, since I got around 19 new subs since.

My setup is very simplistic at the moment. I just had to buy one of the cheapest USB microphones as [my P52 notebook's (here is my review)](/electronics/Thinkpad-P52-vs-HP-Zbook-15-G5-vs-Dell-Precision-7530) jack 3.5 was polluted with noise.
The microphone CONNECT IT CMI-8000-CH YouMic USB works quite well for the $16 I payed.
You can verify the mic quality by listening to one of [my older videos](https://youtu.be/gyBdnNY1WPI).
