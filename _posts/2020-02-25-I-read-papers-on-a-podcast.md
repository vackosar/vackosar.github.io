To improve my pronunciation and speech, I daily mostly ML read papers on [a podcast](https://youtu.be/gyBdnNY1WPI).

And it does work. I think I am able to speak faster and with more precision than I did before I started. Furthermore I read much more papers than before. Also, I at least some people like the content, since I got around 19 new subs since.

My setup is very simplistic at the moment. I just had to buy one of the cheapest USB microphones as [my notebook's](/2019/03/03/Thinkpad-P52-vs-HP-Zbook-15-G5-vs-Dell-Precision-7530.html) jack 3.5 was polluted with noise.

I also was improved room sound quality by [hiding acoustic panel behind a world map](/2020/02/23/Stealthy-acoustic-panels.html).
