I read a book about 38 Letters Rockefeller's to his son. I really enjoyed it at first, but then it started to sound suspicious to me. The language was somehow too modern, like from a self-help book from 2010. I read online reviews, I found similar complaints that referred to the archives of the letters, about how the book was first published in China, and that the content is completely different in the original sources.

I studied the online archive, bought another book of Rockefeller quotes, and ordered physically book called "[Dear Father, Dear Son](https://a.co/d/4rsZQsv)" and skimmed through it in one evening. And I have a completely different feeling from it. Those 38 letters are fictional partially based on various quotes and historical events, but mostly fictional and sometimes completely made up (e.g. the car chase).

The real letters from the archive collected by J.W. Ernst in "[Dear Father, Dear Son](https://a.co/d/4rsZQsv)" are completely different. Less instructive in the self-help direction, but beautiful. They are full of familial love and gratitude, which I think is also a productivity enhancing mental technology based on my other recent readings. The archived letters reveal deep family love, a father's guidance to his son, the son's acceptance of that wisdom, the weight of a near-billion-dollar legacy, and an unshakable belief in a benevolent God.

## Why is The 38 Letters Book a Fiction?
"The 38 Letters from J.D. Rockefeller to his son" are a fictional letters: The signs are:
- Why the author has only one book on Amazon and who they are?
- Why there was no book like this one published before 2020? Why was the book published first in Chinese in 2015?
- Who is the books publisher "OS"? Another version specifies "Independently published" (August 5, 2021). Does it mean, the book didn't pass any filter?
- Why the style of the text is so modern, and the letters end with "Love, Father" where the letters I found end mostly "Affectionately, Father". Why does the writer's character does not match the other books? 

This is a reminder why you have to be skeptical. Read more on how to spot fakes here: [Validate Reliability of a Research Paper](/ml/Validate-Reliability-of-Research-Paper).


## Another Caution
Regardless of the above, any quotes or books are at risk of not being useful to You, the reader. You are unique or can become unique, living in a unique time and place. Books are mere words that gain meaning when acted on. You may find it more beneficial to describe the world in your own words from the experience of interacting with it.

## The Best Quotes From The Real Letters
These are extractions from letters in book "[Dear Father, Dear Son](https://a.co/d/4rsZQsv)", that captured my attention.

- not the whim of any small individual stockholder, or a desire to make a market to sell this stock, the prime factor is, as I state, to keep the concern strong, prosperous, vigorous, aggressive, on its own feet and on its own merits.

## Other Rockefeller Quotes
I verified sources for a couple of these, but not all yet. You can consider reading books [Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. ](https://www.amazon.com/Titan-Life-John-Rockefeller-Sr/dp/1400077303) and [John D. Rockefeller on Making Money: Advice and Words of Wisdom on Building and Sharing Wealth](https://a.co/d/i4pUfEJ).

- I investigated and worked myself almost to a nervous breakdown, in groping my way through the ever-widening field of philanthropic endeavor.
- A great number of scientific men every year give up everything to arrive at some helpful contribution to the sum of human knowledge, and I have sometimes thought that good people who lightly and freely criticize their actions scarcely realize just what such criticism means. It is one thing to stand on the comfortable ground of placid inaction and put forth words of cynical wisdom, and another to plunge into the work itself and through strenuous experience earn the right to express strong conclusions.
- Do not many of us who fail to achieve big things ... fail because we lack concentrationâ€”the art of concentrating the mind on the thing to be done at the proper time and to the exclusion of everything else?
- Criticism which is deliberate, sober, and fair is always valuable and it should be welcomed by all who desire progress. I have had at least my full share of adverse criticism, but I can truly say that it has not embittered me, nor left me with any harsh feeling against a living soul. Nor do I wish to be critical of those whose conscientious judgment, frankly expressed, differs from my own. No matter how noisy the pessimists may be, we know that the world is getting better steadily and rapidly, and that is a good thing to remember in our moments of depression or humiliation.
- Donâ€™t be a good fellow. I love my fellow man and I take great interest in him. But donâ€™t be convivial, always ready to pitch in and be one of the crowd. Be moderate. Be very moderate. Donâ€™t let good fellowship get the least hold on you. If you do, you are lost, not only you but your progeny, your family for generations to come.
- Donâ€™t even think of temporary or sharp advantages. Donâ€™t waste your effort on a thing which ends in a petty triumph unless you are satisfied with a life of petty success. Be sure that before you go into an enterprise you see your way clear to stay through to a successful end. Look ahead
- Do not be discouraged ... I had many refusals, I did not give up.
- Donâ€™t even think of temporary or sharp advantages. Donâ€™t waste your effort on a thing which ends in a petty triumph unless you are satisfied with a life of petty success. Be sure that before you go into an enterprise you see your way clear to stay through to a successful end. Look ahead.
- Save when you can and not when you have to.
- If you want to succeed you should strike out on new paths, rather than travel the worn paths of accepted success.
- Donâ€™t be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.
- The road to happiness lies in two simple principles: find what interests you and that you can do well, and put your whole soul into itâ€”every bit of energy and ambition and natural ability you have.
- Try to turn every disaster into an opportunity.
- Will the individual strive for success if he knows the hard-won prize is to be snatched from him at last by his government? We must build up, build up for years to come.

- I admit I tried to attract only the able men; and I have always had as little as possible to do with dull business men.
- I would rather hire a man with enthusiasm than a man who knows everything.
- In working with so many partners, the conservative ones are apt to be in the majority, and this is no doubt a desirable thing when the mere momentum of a large concern is certain to carry it forward. The men who have been very successful are correspondingly conservative, since they have much to lose in case of disaster. But fortunately there are also the aggressive and more daring ones, and they are usually the youngest in the company, perhaps few in number, but impetuous and convincing. They want to accomplish things and to move quickly, and they donâ€™t mind any amount of work or responsibility.
- A laborer is worthy of his hire, no less, but no more, and in the long run he must contribute an equivalent for what he is paid. If he does not do this, he is probably pauperized, and you at once throw out the balance of things. You canâ€™t hold up conditions artificially, and you canâ€™t change the underlying laws of trade. If you try, you must inevitably fail. All this may be trite and obvious, but it is remarkable how many men overlook what should be the obvious. These are facts we canâ€™t get away fromâ€”a business man must adapt himself to the natural conditions as they exist from month to month and year to year.
- We men from the country are willing to do more work. We were prepared by our experience to do hard work.

- He was engaged in different enterprises; he used to tell me about these things, explaining their significance; and he taught me the principles and methods of business.

- Going back . . . to my early business days and boyhood, the Baptists I knew listened to their consciences and their religious instructions, not only did not dance in public places but did not dance anywhere and did not even concede the reputability of dancing. . . . The theater was considered a source of depravity, to be shunned by conscientious Christians.
- As I study wealthy men, I can see but one way in which they can secure a real equivalent for money spent, and that is to cultivate a taste for giving where the money may produce an effect which will be a lasting gratification.
- Good management consists of showing average people how to do the work of superior people.
- The whole system of proper relations, whether it be in commerce, or in the Church, or in the sciences, rests on honor. Able business men seek to confine their dealings to people who tell the truth and keep their promises; and the representatives of the Church, who are often prone to attack business men as a type of what is selfish and mean, have some great lessons to learn, and they will gladly learn them as these two types of workers grow closer together.
