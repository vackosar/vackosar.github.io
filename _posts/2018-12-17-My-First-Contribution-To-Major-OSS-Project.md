Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. I added certain [extension point enhancement](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/81d377d772a527d9ae3311be0480e6403769e919) that we need for OSS project Spline. [Spline](https://absaoss.github.io/spline/) is data lineage tracking tool that I work on for ABSA.
