- Keep the pace
- Clear your mind
- Improve mood

Military cadence is a call-and-response work song sung by military personnel while running or marching to maintain a united pace.
If you are like my past self, you are having problems running as far as you would like and you will benefit greatly from listening to jody calls.

Listening to these chants will make you feel bad slowing down your pace - not being up to speed with virtual others.
And the same time, it blanks your mind, and puts you into an active, but also meditative state.

## Try Now
You can try this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxA-_MWT_24&start=662), or download couple [cadence calls here](/files/cadence.zip).


## Positive Stress
Any other reason to run? Well, temporarily increased stress or optimal level stress in general seems to be good for health.

## Running Triples Your Speed For Extra One Third Of Calories
Based on [1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221975400_Energy_Expenditure_Comparison_Between_Walking_and_Running_in_Average_Fitness_Individuals) and [2](https://www.verywell.com/does-running-burn-more-calories-than-walking-3435132)
normal walking speed of 2.5 mph on average consumes around 87 calories per mile while running at speed of 7 mph will consume only 32 extra calories, which is 37% per mile extra.

### Update 2020-07-06

After finding that I am not motivated enough for high-intensity interval training, which is superior after a certain fitness point, I returned to the above method today. And it works as perfect as ever.

### Update 2022-04-15
Restarting again :)
