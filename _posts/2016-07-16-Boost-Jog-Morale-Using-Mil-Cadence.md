- Keep the pace
- Clear your mind
- Improve mood

Military cadence is a call-and-response work song sung by military personnel while running or marching to maintain a united pace.
If you are like my past self, you are having problems running as far as you would like and you will benefit greatly from listening to jody calls.

Listening to these chants will make you feel bad slowing down your pace - not being up to speed with virtual others.
And the same time, it blanks your mind, and puts you into an active, but also meditative state. It makes you truly love your life.
