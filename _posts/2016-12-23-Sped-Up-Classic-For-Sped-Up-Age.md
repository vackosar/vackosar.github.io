In that case you may want to try to listen to sped up classical music.
It partially brings the historical music to current age.
Particularly the third movement of Moonlight Sonata: Presto agitato, which feels as almost modern music.
Another very good one is much more famous Bach's Toccata.
You can try it both below.

Speeding up music by power of two does not affect position of notes on musical scale. For example C is transformed to C again only higher pitched one.
