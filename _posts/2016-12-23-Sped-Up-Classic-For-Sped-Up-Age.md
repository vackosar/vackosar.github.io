In that case, you may want to try to listen to sped-up classical music.
It partially brings historical music to the current age.
Particularly the third movement of Moonlight Sonata: Presto agitato feels as almost modern music.
Another perfect one is much more famous - Bach's Toccata.
You can try both below.

Speeding up music by power of two does not affect position of notes on musical scale. For example C is transformed to C again only higher pitched one.

Try other uploads apart from the above:
- [The Toccata and Fugue in D minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENeqCgdxo3Q)
- [Carmina Burana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2NtxXCpad4)
