To minimize [high risk of backdoor in chinese hardware](#backdoor-risk) this post covers recommendation on how to buy a notebook not made in China.
 
 
## Backdoor Risk
China needs the tracking data to implement [Social Credit System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System) in order to rate their citizens.
A friend of low-credit citizen may be for example prevented from travelling or from admission to a school.
If have to choose who will spy on you, I recommend to pick the west.

Unfortunately privacy violation is not just mainland issue.
Many international chinese apps like [WeChat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat#Privacy_issues), [Tik Tok](https://rufposten.de/blog/2019/12/05/privacy-analysis-of-tiktoks-app-and-website/), [Vanguard anti-cheat](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/g35w87/an_individuals_take_on_the_whole_vanguard/), [Zoom](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-23/zoom-backlash-widens-with-daimler-ericsson-and-bofa-curbs?srnd=premium-europe) have well known low-to-zero privacy adherance. 
This is caused partially by monitoring being already built-in for domestic market and value of the collected data, but likely also by the spy agencies interest in the global data.

Apple reportedly looks to protect its privacy concerned brand by considering [shifting production out of China](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-examines-feasibility-of-shifting-some-production-out-of-china-11561030751).


## Old Machines
10+ yrs old machines were build in era when monitoring was not obvious target.
But unless you are setting up high-security system or have very low performance need, I don't recommend going for low compute.
Instead supporting companies that are not vulnerable is better solution.


## Solving the problem
Out of the box solution could be Purism they remove parts of Intel management engine.

Select components:
- TODO
- [Intel is only partially exposed](https://www.reuters.com/article/intel-trade/intel-has-paths-around-trumps-china-tariffs-analysts-say-idUSL1N1TL02B). However their processors have large attack surface of Intel Management Engine
- [AMD partially exposed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/buj1wp/amd_zen2_manufacturing_locations/)

Select manufacturer:
- Low exposure: Toshiba, Fujitsu, Samsung, Panasonic, Sharp, System 76
- Exposed: Apple, HP, Dell, Micromax, Vaio
- Highly exposed: Asus, Acer 
- Avoid: Lenovo, Huawei, Xiaomi

Select software:
- Avoid: Zoom, Tik Tok, Tencent games,
