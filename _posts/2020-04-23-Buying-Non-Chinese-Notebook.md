To minimize [high risk of backdoor in chinese hardware](#backdoor-risk) this post covers recommendation on how to buy a notebook.
 
 
## Backdoor Risk
China needs the tracking data to implement [Social Credit System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System) in order to rate their citizens.
A friend of low-credit citizen may be for example prevented from travelling or from admission to a school.

But privacy violation is not just mainland issue.
Many international chinese apps like [WeChat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat#Privacy_issues), [Tik Tok](https://rufposten.de/blog/2019/12/05/privacy-analysis-of-tiktoks-app-and-website/), [Vanguard anti-cheat](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/g35w87/an_individuals_take_on_the_whole_vanguard/) have well known low-to-zero privacy adherance. 
This is caused partially by already having to monitor citizens in china, value of the collected data, but probably also by the government interest in the global data.

Apple apparently to protect its privacy concerned brand is considering [shifting production out of China](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-examines-feasibility-of-shifting-some-production-out-of-china-11561030751).


## Old Machines
10+ yrs old machines were build in era when monitoring was not obvious target.
But unless you are setting up high-security system or have very low performance demand, I don't recommend going for the low compute.
Instead supporting companies that are not exposed to the risk is better solution.


## Solving the problem
Out of the box solution could be Purism they remove parts of Intel management engine.

Select components:
- TODO
- [Intel is only partially exposed](https://www.reuters.com/article/intel-trade/intel-has-paths-around-trumps-china-tariffs-analysts-say-idUSL1N1TL02B)
- 

Select manufacturer:
- Low exposure: Toshiba, Fujitsu, Samsung, Panasonic, Sharp, System 76
- Exposed: Apple, HP, Dell, Micromax, Vaio
- Highly exposed: Asus, Acer
