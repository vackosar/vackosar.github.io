## Flow-Based Model vs VAE and GAN
1. Exact latent-variable inference and log-likelihood (invertible) compared to approximate VAE (compressed) and absent GAN representations (discriminated).
1. Easy to parallelize both synthesis and inference.
1. Useful latent space similar to VAE, but richer as it is not compressed.
1. With respect to depth constant memory requirements for gradient calculations thanks to invertibility.


## Invertible building block

The goal is to find an invertible function, which under assumption of multi-variate normal distribution with isotropic unit variance on the latent space gives maximum likelihood.
The invertible function is constructed as composition of K trainable non-linear invertible functions.

and

Then transformation to `y` below is can be inverted:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y_{I_2} = x_{I_2} * s(x_{I_1}) + t(x_{I_1})">

While determinant of Jacobian of above transformation is:
