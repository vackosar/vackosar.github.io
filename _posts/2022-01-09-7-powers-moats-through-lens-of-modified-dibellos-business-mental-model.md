The [Helmer's 7 Powers book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32816087-7-powers) lists 7 barriers that protect margins of businesses long term and how to attain them.
[DiBello's research](https://wtri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Informed-By-Knowledge-Chapter-12.pdf) suggests that great business people understand interaction between following three aspects (dimensions) of a business: demand, supply, capital.
The text below may provide additional insights into both through partial modification, followed by combination of the ideas above.
For example, Helmer's book does not list capital side of the described moats and network effects between suppliers and between investors, while below hints that they may exist.

_I have partially restated and aligned some of the concepts from the references to offer interesting view, so be aware._
_Additionally, this is my initial version of the post on this topic._

## DiBello Mental Model Dimensions
DiBello's research suggests that there is a triad of crucial aspects of a business that great business people understand.
Here I state the original and modified DiBello's dimensions of mental model of business, adding units, agents, and related terms.

### DiBello's Dimensions
For details, I recommend reading [Mental Model of Business](https://commoncog.com/blog/business-mental-model/) or the [original paper](https://wtri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Informed-By-Knowledge-Chapter-12.pdf).

The three core areas are:
- Supply, or leadership: factors involved in effective operations
  - related terms: incentives, systems, design blueprints, manufacturing, production, product development
  - agents: employees, management
  - comment: This dimension deals with company-internal matters. Here the company transforms the inputs into outputs.
- Demand, or strategy: forces influencing the market
  - related terms: deal, sale, brand asset, positioning, marketing ...
  - agents: customers, suppliers, competition, government, prospect
  - comment: This dimension represents exchange with the outside. Here the company inputs and outputs are connected. I think each company trades at least 2 different types of goods e.g. in leading one of the goods is a contract.
- Capital, or finance: driving business finance and economic climates
  - related terms: financial performance, cost of goods sold, fixed assets, receivables, R&D, cashflow, debt, equity receivables, cost of capital ...
  - agents: investors, bondholders, CFO
  - comment: I see this dimension as a mainly quantitative or performance measuring, because various inputs and outputs are already part of the demand. Capital is different (more liquidity, services), but not sure if enough different.

Note 1: Nick Huber of Sweaty Startup seems to be thinking along the two of the main dimensions describes "[Every company has a customer or a employee problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJmT9n0XbIU)".

Note 2: Every company seems have to involve some transformation between two types of goods (input, output or bi-directional) and exchange of them in the market.
Even annuity is transformation of a lump sum into time-distributed payments (capital over time).
Finance above plays a role of monitoring of quantitative attributes of the exchanges, the Demand is the exchange itself, the Supply is involved with the processes and algorithms used to achieve the transformation.


[//]: # (Note 4: Certain terms may be cross-cutting or agnostic e.g. CEO, which operates across all of the dimensions.)

### Modified DiBello Dimensions
Below dimensions are changed such that each of them involves interaction with the world outside the company,
includes employee roles and specialized metrics like COS.

Many terms in business cannot fall on the single dimension listed below.
The point of a business is in fact to function across the dimensions to create value.

- Demand (marketing, market trends, competitive analysis, positioning)
	- unit: deal, sale, brand asset, ...
	- agents: customers, marketing agencies, marketers, CMO, Business Development, users, ...
	- terms: competition, prospect, cost of goods sold, return on ads spend, ...
- Supply (manufacturing, production, product development)
	- units: product, service, productive asset (machine), ...
	- agents: suppliers, builders, CTO, procurement, cloud providers, ...
	- terms: design, blueprints, cost of production, ...
- Capital (financing, economic climate)
	- unit: money, financial assets, ...
	- agents: investors, bondholders, accountants, CFO, ...
	- terms: cashflow, debt, equity receivables, cost of capital ...

Certain terms are sometimes assigned by DiBello into other dimensions than as in above e.g. cost of goods sold is instead listed under the Capital dimension.
For example, DiBello would probably place suppliers into the Demand, while I list them in Supply.

Suppliers are distinguished from customers by the direction of flow of money. In case of Google users and webpage owners are suppliers and advertisers are customers. If the flow is bidirectional suppliers may be indistinguishable from customers, which seems rare.

Dimension agnostic (cross-cutting) terms and agents are: CEO, technology, operations, human resources, management, security, software, R&D, execution, planning.
These exist or take action in two or more dimensions.

## 7 Powers From Perspective of DiBello's 
Helmer's book defines Power as "the set of conditions creating the potential for persistent differential returns".
It is about building defensive moat, or a barrier to protect margins from competitive arbitrage.
For a summary I recommend reading [7 Powers summary](https://commoncog.com/blog/7-powers-summary/).
Below I offer a view of the powers through the lens of DiBello's model.
I split them according to company stage to which they become accessible.


### Startup Stage Powers
- Counter-positioning - Where big players cannot follow?
	- benefited dimensions: supply, demand, capital
	- barrier: big players optimized in local maximum with lots of trust cannot follow 
	- examples: specialized production, niche market, business model
- Cornered-Resource - What can you own exclusively almost all of?
	- benefited dimensions: supply, demand, capital
	- barrier: external force of contracts, laws
	- examples: exclusive contract, patent, regulation, property, employee, exclusive funding
	
### Scaleup Stage Powers
- Switching costs - Why customers, suppliers, investors cannot switch to competition cheaply?
    - benefited dimensions: supply, demand, capital
    - barrier: competitor has to pay switching costs
    - examples: deep integration with systems, data and configuration stored in the systems, habits
- Scale - How to pay fixed-cost or network the agents?
    - Scale Economies (Supply side-scale) - production fixed-costs or networking suppliers
        - benefited dimensions: supply
        - barrier: market share
        - examples: shooting movies to distribute across subscribers ([Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix))
    - Demand-side Scale Economy (Network) - Demand fixed-costs or networking customers
        - benefited dimensions: demand
        - barrier: market share
        - examples: social networks (Facebook), marketing fixed-costs ([Red Bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull)), recommender systems, Google ranking
    - "Capital Scale Economies" - Capital fixed-costs or networking investors
        - benefited dimensions: capital
        - barrier: market share
        - examples:
          - IPO has high fixed-costs of regulatory reporting
		  - Investor network effects perhaps exist as [reflexivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory)#In_economics) (the more people want the Mona Lisa the higher it is priced)
		  - [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) brings in new possibilities, so perhaps we see more in future? 
		
### Corp-up Stage Powers
- Hysteresis (optimization, trust, stability)
	- Process Power - What creates non-replicable and stable organizational capability?
		- benefited dimensions: supply
		- lower costs per unit of supply due to optimization and trust of suppliers
		- barrier: time in production
	- Branding - What accrues trust and nostalgia with users and markets optimally?
		- benefited dimension: demand
		- lower costs per unit of demand due to optimization and trust of customers
		- barrier: time in market
	- "Lindy Effect" - What accrues trust and optimizes capital operations?
		- benefited dimension: capital
		- low cost of capital thanks to optimization and trust of investors
		- example: Blue chip stocks

I only found about topics above thanks to Cedric's blog posts over at [Common Place Blog](https://commoncog.com/blog/).
I am personally a paying subscriber of the Commonplace blog to have access to member's only posts and the community.
Also thanks to Cedric explaining that I modified the definition of the DiBello's model and a lots of other good comments.
