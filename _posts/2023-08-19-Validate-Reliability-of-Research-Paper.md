Research is a large extent a media endeavour,
and so there is a large incentive to reach out for the fame by surprise breakthrough or confirmation the most extraordinary dreams and biases.
Common problems are unfair or irrelevant comparisons, or misunderstanding of what is measured.
To avoid wasting time on unlikely results, consider diligence methods below to analyze claim's validity.

## The Main Contribution's Relevance and Importance
Primary questions for each research to ask is:
1. What is the main idea in one sentence? Usually there is just one main idea, that can be summarized into one sentence even if you are not an expert in the research area.
2. What impact this may have and why is this important and relevant?
3. What are the unknowns and open questions? What does not fit well?


## Doomberg's 5 Question Framework
The most interesting set of questions, I came across were Doomberg's 5 questions that this independently thinking industry research group shared on a podcast. There is also a paywalled article [Conducting Diligence](https://doomberg.substack.com/p/conducting-diligence).

1. Credibility: What is the reputation of the researchers and the institutions they are affiliated with?
2. Publication Source: Where were these results published? Were they peer-reviewed or self-published as preprints? Who is further republishing it and what are their biases?
3. Scientific Process: At what stage is this research in the scientific process of validation and publishing? How often are similar results retracted?
4. Scientific Context: What does existing research and the history of this field suggest about these findings?
5. Future Expectations: What should we expect next? When and how will these results be reproduced successfully?


## Other tests

There are various tests:
1. The CRAAP Test: This easy to remember acronym stands for Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose, and it guides users to assess the quality and relevance of information sources.

2. SIFT Method: The SIFT (Stop, Investigate the source, Find better coverage, Trace claims) method, is a simple four-step process for evaluating information online.

3. TRAAP Test: Similar to the CRAAP test, the TRAAP (Timeliness, Relevance, Authority, Audience and Purpose) test is used to assess the reliability of a source and the information it provides.

4. RADAR Framework: This stands for Rationale, Authority, Date, Accuracy, and Relevance. It essentially helps users to assess the quality, reliability, and usefulness of a resource.

5. PICO Framework: Used in evidence based practice to formulate a searchable clinical question. It stands for Patient problem or Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome.
