Research is a large extent a media endeavour,
and so there is a large incentive to reach out for the fame by surprise breakthrough or confirmation the most extraordinary dreams and biases.
Common problems are unfair or irrelevant comparisons, or misunderstanding of what is measured.
To avoid wasting time on unlikely results, consider diligence methods below to analyze claim's validity.

## The Main Contribution's Relevance and Importance
Primary questions for each research to ask is:
1. What is the main idea in one sentence? Usually there is just one main idea, that can be summarized into one sentence even if you are not an expert in the research area.
2. What impact this may have and why is this important and relevant?
3. What are the unknowns and open questions? What does not fit well?


## Doomberg's 5 Question Framework (Expanded)
This is a expansion of the questions mentioned in a podcast.
The most interesting set of questions, I came across were Doomberg's 5 questions that this independently thinking industry research group shared on a podcast. There is also a paywalled article [Conducting Diligence](https://doomberg.substack.com/p/conducting-diligence). I don't have full access to the text as of now.

1. Author Credibility: What is the reputation of the researchers and the institutions they are affiliated with? Who funded them?
  - Follow the money: Are researches biased, e.g. do their livelihoods, views, or identities tied to any of the results? For example, some research is funded by a for profit company, which they introduces goal-oriented bias into the research. (Try investing in a company and then tell me what it does to your views.)
  - If the results come from outsiders, without interest in any usual views, it may shed new light, but with less authority on the subject.
2. Publication Venue Credibility: Where were these results published? Were they peer-reviewed or self-published as preprints? Who is further republishing it and what are their biases and intentions?
3. Scientific Process: At what stage is this research in the scientific process of validation and publishing? How often are similar results retracted?
  - Is this Randomized double blind placebo control (RDBPC) trial? Or could have the researchers changed the results?
  - What is the specific evidence for the claims?
4. Scientific Context: What does existing research and the history of this field suggest about these findings? Why was this published now?
5. Future Expectations: What should we expect next? When and how will these results be reproduced successfully? How large are implications of the findings?


## Other tests

There are various tests:
1. The CRAAP Test: This easy to remember acronym stands for Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose, and it guides users to assess the quality and relevance of information sources.

2. SIFT Method: The SIFT (Stop, Investigate the source, Find better coverage, Trace claims) method, is a simple four-step process for evaluating information online.

3. TRAAP Test: Similar to the CRAAP test, the TRAAP (Timeliness, Relevance, Authority, Audience and Purpose) test is used to assess the reliability of a source and the information it provides.

4. RADAR Framework: This stands for Rationale, Authority, Date, Accuracy, and Relevance. It essentially helps users to assess the quality, reliability, and usefulness of a resource.

5. PICO Framework: Used in evidence based practice to formulate a searchable clinical question. It stands for Patient problem or Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome.
