I wanted at least __15inch display__ processor __i7-8750H__, reasonable graphics __P1000__, at least __max 64GB RAM__, __RJ45__, __trackpoint__, physical __resilience__. I decided to buy ZBook 15 G5 over Thinkpad P52 and Precision 7530 and below are my reasons.

I also shortly considered a wild card _14inch Latitude 5491_ as it had attractive price, but it missed too many of the requirements (poor cooling, low max ram, poor physical resilience, low graphics).

### Thinkpad P52

- max RAM 128GB
- best trackpoint
- worst cooling ([single heatpipe](http://forum.notebookreview.com/attachments/cooling_comparison-png.160125/), [prolonged cinebench performance dropoff](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-P52-i7-P1000-FHD-Workstation-Review.322974.0.html))
- replaceable battery
- medium physical resilience

### Precision 7530 

- max RAM 128GB
- worst trackpoint
- [medium cooling](https://scene7-cdn.dell.com/is/image//DellComputer/workstation-precision-7530-html5-thumb-image-set?wid=1110&fmt=png-alpha)
- no replaceable battery
- less physical resilience
- extra M.2 drive slot

### ZBook 15 G5

- max RAM only 64GB
- medium trackpoint
- very good [cooling](https://f1.media.brightcove.com/8/1160438711001/1160438711001_5763673639001_5763663561001-vs.jpg?pubId=4119874066001&videoId=5763349495001) but [after repaste](http://forum.notebookreview.com/threads/dell-precision-7530-hp-zbook-15-g5-or-lenovo-thinkpad-p52.820474/page-26#post-10817321)
- replaceable battery ([tooless access also to RAM, HDD](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4jW1loaLgyI/maxresdefault.jpg))
- best physical resilience (aluminium)

### Update on ZBook G5 15

I bought ZBook G5 15:

- Charging port is too thin and probably will be damaged soon
- Page Up, Page Down keys are not as conveniently placed as on Thinkpads
- Home, End, Insert keys were replaced by useless keys Desktop, Call, Hang Up contrary to Thinkpad
- Home, End moved to the top right
- Insert key completely removed!
- While the notebook should have passed MIL tests it doesnt really seem resilient as Thinkpad
- Without repaste the performance on Cinebench R15 drops to [1030 the same as on Thinkpad P52](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-P52-i7-P1000-FHD-Workstation-Review.322974.0.html)
- Overall, I think I will be replacing the notebook with P52
