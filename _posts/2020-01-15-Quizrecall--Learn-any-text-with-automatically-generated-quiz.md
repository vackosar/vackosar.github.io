I used [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to learn various Math, Stats and Software Dev definitions. But I kept having 3 problems with it. I resolved them with developing app [Quizrecall](https://quizrecall.com). Read on and maybe the app may be something for you as well.

### Anki Issues

1. But I constantly had a problem with *having to spend a lot of time with creating my flashcards*. Overtime I moved from creating front-back card to just fill-in-the-blank questions to reduce effort. But that still felt too slow. I knew it must be possible to create the cloze questions automatically. And overtime I developed an algo to do that for me.

2. Another issue I had with Anki was that I was *loosing attention during the reviews*. I kept zoning out and kept self-assessing my self as "Good" without actually recalling anything. The only alternative is to actually be remember correctly by making a choice to prove that I remember correctly.

3. Last problem was reoccurring for me with Anki was that felt like I was sometimes losing *too much time during card review*. But when I configured time limit to answer, it only increased the focus problem.


### Quizrecall as a solution

I solved all of these problems for myself by developing [Quizrecall](https://quizrecall.com) application to which I switched fully recently. It automatically generates fill-in-the-blank (cloze) questions for me. Generates alternative answers, pushes me to click the correct answer and the answer correctness also depends on time needed to answer.

### Conclusion

I am happy with finding solution for my issues with Anki. You can try the [Quizrecall](https://quizrecall.com) yourself. I am committed to using and improving the app overtime as it is genuinely reducing time needed for me to memorize and learn. and I think you may very well like it as well.
