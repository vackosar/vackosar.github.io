I used [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to learn various Math, Stats and Software Dev definitions. But I kept having 3 problems with it. I resolved them with developing [a web app Quizrecall - an automated quiz generator with spaced repetition](https://quizrecall.com). Read on and maybe the app may be something for you as well.

### Anki Issues

1. *Time to create*: But I constantly had a problem with *having to spend a lot of time with creating my flashcards*. Overtime I moved from creating front-back card to just fill-in-the-blank questions to reduce effort. But that still felt too slow. I knew it must be possible to create the cloze questions automatically. And overtime I developed an algo to do that for me.

2. *Self-assessment*: Another issue I had with Anki was that I was *loosing attention during the reviews*. I kept zoning out and self-assessing my self as "Good" without actually recalling anything. The the issue here is that Anki allows you to just keep pushing one green button.

3. *Time to review*: Last problem for me with Anki was that spending *too much time during card review*. I tried configuring time limit to answer, but it only increased the focus problem in point 2 above.


### Quizrecall as a solution

I solved all of these problems for myself by developing [Quizrecall](https://quizrecall.com) app to which I switched fully recently. It works only with text, but right now it is enough.
1. Generates fill-in-the-blank (cloze) _questions_ and _alternative answers_
3. Pushes me to actually select the correct answer from 3 options
3. The answer correctness also decreases with elapsed time needed to answer

### Conclusion

I am happy with finding solution for my issues with Anki. You can try [the automated quiz learning app](https://quizrecall.com) yourself. I am committed to using and improving the app overtime, because it is genuinely reducing the my effort to memorize and learn.

I think you may very well like it as well. Try it with your favourite Wikipedia article summary.
