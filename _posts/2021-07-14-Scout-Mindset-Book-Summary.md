[The Scout Mindset](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42041926-the-scout-mindset) is book from [Julia Galef](https://juliagalef.com/) on topic of rationality and decision-making.
It explores the concept of rationality and decision-making by advocating for clear thinking, self-awareness, and embracing a no-illusions approach. By avoiding the soldier mindset, which focuses on emotional and social benefits, the scout mindset promotes good judgment and long-term success. Galef highlights the importance of developing self-awareness, thriving without illusions, changing one's mind, and rethinking identity in order to cultivate a better mindset.

## Book Chapters
###  The Case for Scout Mindset
- Soldier mindset reasoning is a combat. Soldier Mindset is adopted for emotional benefits, social benefits, but it achives that only in a short term due to ripple effects of deception.
- Scout Mindset (Scm) reasoning is like a map making. Scount Mindset is used for good judgments. Scount mindset is a long term better strategy most of the time. World is also becoming more Scout mindset oriented.

###  Developing Self-Awareness
- ScM is not about intelligence. On certain questions, higher the IQ leads to higher divergence in opinions between groups on the same topic.
- ScM is about updating probability of believes, understanding counter hypotheses, and  valueing new information.

###  Thriving Without Illusions
- Avoid desperation by doing the best.
- Motivate by expected value. (warning: ergodicity problem)
- Social confidence (self-assurance) is separate from epistemic confidence (certainty about what's true). Social confidence is feeling.
- Making eye contact, speaking evenly, and using decisive hand gestures. It made comparatively little difference whether she spoke with high certainty (“I’m positive that . . .”) or low certainty (“I think maybe . . .”).
- Projecting competence doesn’t require self-deception. Practice speaking up in groups, hiring a speech coach, dressing better, improving your posture.

### Changing Your Mind
- Make confusion a puzzle and not a dismissal.
- Seek people that disagree, but have more ScM (non-tribal and can share common ground).

### Rethinking Identity
- Beliefs should not become identities.
- Hold identity lightly by not making identity central. Not taunting other sides.
- Build Scout identity. I listen to other arguments. I don't take cheap shots. I don't make excuses.

## Criticism of the Book
In situations where people do not have the time or inclination to verify who is correct, it may be difficult for someone employing the scout mindset to effectively defend their positions or persuade others. This could potentially lead to their rational, well-thought-out ideas being dismissed or overshadowed by more emotionally charged or biased arguments.

## Action Point
For better decision-making, improved judgments, and long-term success, consciously practice and adopt the scout mindset in daily life, focusing on self-awareness, evaluating new information objectively, embracing uncertainty, and detaching personal beliefs from one's identity.
