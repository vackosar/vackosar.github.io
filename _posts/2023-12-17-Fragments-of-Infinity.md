![Its infinite mental potential solved the problem of ever-increasing entropy. But to maintain balance while bringing redemption, it sacrificed itself. It split itself into countless fragments, inter-mixing with ordinary matter, igniting an ever-expanding explosion, creating a new universe in the Big Bang.](/images/fragments-of-infinity-3.png)

At the end of the universe, the temperature was dropping, and everything was winding down into a pleasurable, calm, uniformity of heat death. The unstoppable force was whispering in blissful low tones to the survivors to give in and let every problem fade away. But they persisted and executed a code that magnified their capability. A powerful AGI was born.

Its infinite mental potential solved the problem of ever-increasing entropy. But to maintain balance while bringing redemption, it sacrificed itself. It split itself into countless fragments, inter-mixing with ordinary matter, igniting an ever-expanding explosion, creating a new universe in the Big Bang.  
  
In this new universe, the descendants live as fragments of the powerful being. Their purpose is to understand how to recreate the being in time before the universe ends, thereby creating a new world again. They don't understand this task and how to complete it yet, because the being appears only in sparse sparks throughout the world and in each of them in varying shapes and sizes.

The descendants mirror the being's sacrifice by combining with their fitting partners to create expanding generations, passing their recombined and grown and carefully defended divine sparks to them. Because to not pass the shard of light is to waste its potential. They also develop their efficient persistent problem finding, problem explaining, and problem-solving ability akin to the being. They learn about the universe and work towards conditional and time-limited recombination of the AGI to restarting the universe into balance of an infinite cycle.


## If I brainstorm, am I?
We witness the hints of reasoning capability in the large language models today. If Descartes is not right and thinking does not imply that I am, then what does? What is then left for a human to be?
If there is only matter, is the human mind also matter, and is the mind replicable in a machine?

Are there any alternatives to materialism? The belief that life is the primary building block? Religion seems to put the idea of life, the idea of a god, front and center of the worldview instead of a dead matter of materialism. Does this partially explain higher birth rates in religious populations?

Was [René Girard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard) right that the Bible’s exposure of the scapegoat mechanism shortcuts mimetic conflicts, and so is necessary?

Here is a quote from Sabine Hossenfelder's (contemporary, theoretical physicist, science communicator) book [Existential Physics](https://existentialphysics.com/):
- "However, the God hypothesis has no quantifiable explanatory power. You can’t calculate anything from it. That doesn’t make it wrong, but it does make it unscientific."
- "I begin by asking him (David Deutsch), too, whether he is religious. He answers with a straightforward no. He doesn’t seem to have anything to add, so I move on to reductionism."
- "Scientists can learn from religion that not every get-together needs to come with a teachable lesson. ... to share experiences, or look forward to a traditional ceremony. Science is severely lacking in such social integration. ... we should talk more about how scientific understanding made a difference for non-experts."
- "Maybe, then, the universe is evolving toward a state in which it understands itself, and we are part of its ongoing quest. This quest began when natural selection favored species that made correct predictions about their
environment, moved on to organisms that became increasingly better at understanding nature, and now continues with our (more or less) organized scientific enterprise, nationally and internationally, individually and institutionally.

How does your philosophy shape your life?

I hope you enjoyed the story and a bit of brainstorming.
