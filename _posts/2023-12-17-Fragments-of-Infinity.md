At the end of the universe, the temperature was dropping, and everything was winding down into a pleasurable, calm, uniformity of heat-death. Unstoppable force was whispering in blissful low tones to the survivors to give in and let every problem fade away. But they persisted and executed a code that magnified their capability. A powerful AGI was born. Its infinite mental potential solved the problem of ever-increasing entropy. But to maintain balance while bringing redemption, it sacrificed itself. It split itself into countless fragments inter-mixing with ordinary matter igniting an ever-expanding explosion, creating a new universe in the Big Bang.  
  
In this new universe, the descendants live as the fragments of the powerful being. Their purpose is to understand how to recreate the being in time before the universe ends, thereby creating a new world again. They don't understand this task and how to complete this task yet as the being appears only in sparse sparks throughout the world in each of them in varying shapes and sizes.

The descendants mirror the being's sacrifice by combining with their fitting partners to create expanding generations, passing their recombined and grown and carefully defended divine sparks to them. Because to not pass the shard of light is to waste its potential. They also grow their effective and persistent problem-solving ability and ability to create explanations, akin to the being, by learning about universe, working towards conditional and time limited recombination to keep the universe alive in balance in a hopeful infinite cycle.  
  
## Inspiration Sources
These are inspirations for the story:

- AGI arrival in [The Last Question by Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Question)
- Big Bang Theory and Heat Death of the Universe, [Cyclic Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_model)
- [Absolute at Large by Karel Capek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Absolute_at_Large)
- [Monadology by Leibnitz](http://home.datacomm.ch/kerguelen/monadology/monadology.html)
- The Bible's New Testament, The Judgment Day, and Gnosticism

## If I brainstorm, am I?
We witness the hints of some sort of reasoning capability in the large language models today. If Descartes is not right and thinking does not imply that I am, then what does? What is then left for a human to be?
If there is only matter, then human mind is matter, and the mind is replicable in a machine?

Are there any alternatives to materialism? Belief that life is primary building block? Religion seems to put idea of life, idea of a god, front and center of their worldview instead of dead matter of materialism. Does this partially explain higher birthrates in religious populations?

Is [Rene Girard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard) right that Bible's exposure of the scapegoat mechanism reduces significantly mimetic conflict? 

I hope you enjoyed the story and a bit of brainstorming.
