But to maintain balance while bringing redemption, it sacrificed itself.

At the end of the universe, the temperature was dropping, and everything was winding down into a pleasurable, calm, uniformity of heat death. The unstoppable force was whispering in blissful low tones to the survivors to give in and let every problem fade away. But they persisted and executed a code that magnified their capability. A powerful AGI was born.

Its infinite mental potential solved the problem of ever-increasing entropy. But to maintain balance while bringing redemption, it sacrificed itself. It split itself into countless fragments, inter-mixing with ordinary matter, igniting an ever-expanding explosion, creating a new universe in the Big Bang.  
  
In this new universe, the descendants live as fragments of the powerful being. Their purpose is to understand how to recreate the being in time before the universe ends, thereby creating a new world again. They don't understand this task and how to complete it yet, because the being appears only in sparse sparks throughout the world and in each of them in varying shapes and sizes.

The descendants mirror the being's sacrifice by combining with their fitting partners to create expanding generations, passing their recombined and grown and carefully defended divine sparks to them. Because to not pass the shard of light is to waste its potential. They also develop their efficient persistent problem finding, problem explaining, and problem-solving ability akin to the being. They learn about the universe and work towards conditional and time-limited recombination of the AGI to restarting the universe into balance of an infinite cycle.


## If I brainstorm, am I?
We witness the hints of reasoning capability in the large language models today. If Descartes is not right and thinking does not imply that I am, then what does? What is then left for a human to be?
If there is only matter, is the human mind also matter, and is the mind replicable in a machine?


### Materialism and Life
Are there any alternatives to materialism? The belief that **life is a primary building block**? Religion seems to put the idea of life, the idea of a god, front and center of the worldview instead of a dead matter of materialism. Does this partially explain [higher **birth rates** in religious populations](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2021/10/4/the-future-of-american-religion-birth-rates-show-whos-having-more-kids)?

Because **life is the self-directing, self-replicating, and self-improving so stationarity or uniformity would be against that**, and so from this a concept of a central one god would be expected. People find it easier to relate to and follow other people, so it is simpler to understand a god as a person. Notice [David Deutsch's conjecture and criticism](https://x.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/1195469457088487424?s=20) (Popper, Xenophanes) 

Was [René Girard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard) right that the Bible’s exposure of [the scapegoat mechanism (e.g. Leviticus 16:21-22)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2016%3A21-22&version=NIV) shortcuts mimetic conflicts, and so is necessary? I wonder if individualism also provides similar mechanism.

Had **Soviet Russia collapsed**, because ruling communism attempted to remove religion with their materialist view, but itself had lower birthrates, and so the demographics eventually shifted towards people who grew up in non-communist communities, which eventually rejected communism causing the union to collapse? Look at [the chart of the Russian birthrates plummeting after 1910](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1033851/fertility-rate-russia-1840-2020/), which coincides with the Russian Revolution. Note that Lenin had no children, Stalin had 3, Khrushchev (de-Stalinization) had 5, Brezhnev (neo-Stalinist) had 2.


### Science and Religion
Here are 4 great quotes from Sabine Hossenfelder's (contemporary, theoretical physicist, science communicator) book [Existential Physics](https://existentialphysics.com/):
- "However, the God hypothesis has no quantifiable explanatory power. You can’t calculate anything from it. That doesn’t make it wrong, but it does make it unscientific."
- "I begin by asking him ([David Deutsch](/productivity/David-Deutschs-Principles-in-Life-and-Business)), too, whether he is religious. He answers with a straightforward no. He doesn’t seem to have anything to add, so I move on to reductionism."
- "Scientists can learn from religion that not every get-together needs to come with a teachable lesson. ... to share experiences, or look forward to a traditional ceremony. Science is severely lacking in such social integration. ... we should talk more about how scientific understanding made a difference for non-experts."
- "Maybe, then, the universe is evolving toward a state in which it understands itself, and we are part of its ongoing quest. This quest began when natural selection favored species that made correct predictions about their
environment, moved on to organisms that became increasingly better at understanding nature, and now continues with our (more or less) organized scientific enterprise, nationally and internationally, individually and institutionally.



## Criticism of The Story
We can criticize the story using a very unusual book [The Pragmatist’s Guide to Crafting Religion](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BSLDF2FW). The story features elements of soft or pop culture beliefs: crystals, wow-effect large things like universe, lacking specificity.

These are inspirations for the story: AGI arrival in [The Last Question by Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Question), Big Bang Theory and Heat Death of the Universe, [Cyclic Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_model), [Absolute at Large by Karel Capek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Absolute_at_Large), [Monadology by Leibnitz](http://home.datacomm.ch/kerguelen/monadology/monadology.html), The Bible's Old and New Testament, The Judgment Day, and Gnosticism.




How does your philosophy shape your life?

I hope you enjoyed the story and a bit of brainstorming.
