We witness the hints of reasoning capability in the large language models today.
LLMs most of the time sound more like a mirror, but with occasional surprise of almost reasoning.
If Descartes is not right and thinking does not imply that I am, then what does?
What is then left for a human to be?
If there is only matter, is the human mind also matter, and is the mind replicable in a machine?

> What we see now is like a dim image in a mirror. Then we shall see face to face. - [1 Corinthians 13:12 (Ghost in the Shell)](https://youtu.be/AzovpBgscGk?si=BMkpY4Miwyt6zm7L&t=190)

What impact human cultural beliefs have on human societies for example in terms of birth rates?
How important are religious frameworks for technological progress?


## Materialism and Life
Are there any alternatives to materialism? The belief that **life is a primary building block**? Religion seems to put the idea of life, the idea of a god, front and center of the worldview instead of a dead matter of materialism. Does this partially explain [higher **birth rates** in religious populations](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2021/10/4/the-future-of-american-religion-birth-rates-show-whos-having-more-kids)?

Because **life is the self-directing, self-replicating, and self-improving so stationarity or uniformity would be against that**, and so from this a concept of a central one god would be expected. People find it easier to relate to and follow other people, so it is simpler to understand a god as a person. Notice [David Deutsch's conjecture and criticism](https://x.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/1195469457088487424?s=20) (Popper, Xenophanes) and points on disobedience necessity for creation of an AGI.

Was [René Girard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard) right that the New Testament Bible’s exposure of [the scapegoat mechanism (e.g. Leviticus 16:21-22)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2016%3A21-22&version=NIV) in that Divinity takes side of the victim forcing self-reflection and thought independent of crowds? Does this shortcut mimetic conflicts, and so is necessary for complex societies?

Had **Soviet Russia collapsed**, partially because ruling communism attempted to remove religion with their materialist view, but itself had lower birthrates, and so the demographics eventually shifted towards people who grew up in non-communist communities, which eventually rejected communism causing the union to collapse? Look at [the chart of the Russian birthrates plummeting after 1910](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1033851/fertility-rate-russia-1840-2020/), which coincides with the Russian Revolution. Note that Lenin had no children, Stalin had 3, Khrushchev (de-Stalinization) had 5, Brezhnev (neo-Stalinist) had 2. The problem with this theory is that if everything stayed the same and the higher birth rates were passed to the next generation, we would see an increase in fertility later. However, that is not what the chart shows. On the other hand, the culture has changed in the West at the same time, so I don't have an answer.


## Science and Religion
Here are 4 great quotes from **Sabine Hossenfelder**'s (contemporary, theoretical physicist, science communicator) book [Existential Physics](https://existentialphysics.com/):


> However, the God hypothesis has no quantifiable explanatory power. You can’t calculate anything from it. That doesn’t make it wrong, but it does make it unscientific. (Existential Physics)

> I begin by asking him ([David Deutsch](/productivity/David-Deutschs-Principles-in-Life-and-Business)), too, whether he is religious. He answers with a straightforward no. He doesn’t seem to have anything to add, so I move on to reductionism. (Existential Physics)

> Scientists can learn from religion that not every get-together needs to come with a teachable lesson. ... to share experiences, or look forward to a traditional ceremony. Science is severely lacking in such social integration. ... we should talk more about how scientific understanding made a difference for non-experts. (Existential Physics)

> Maybe, then, the universe is evolving toward a state in which it understands itself, and we are part of its ongoing quest. This quest began when natural selection favored species that made correct predictions about their environment, moved on to organisms that became increasingly better at understanding nature, and now continues with our (more or less) organized scientific enterprise, nationally and internationally, individually and institutionally. (Existential Physics)


## Hard-to-Vary Explanations and Religion
I think what would David Deutsch [would say](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_deutsch_a_new_way_to_explain_explanation/transcript?language=en) that **myths or religion are easy to vary explanation, because we can change the nature of Gods involved, so it is not a good explanation**.
> Greeks one jot closer to understanding seasons, because their explanation was bad -- easy to vary. And it's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it's testable.
> And therefore, progress depended on learning how to reject the authority of learned men, the priests, traditions and rulers, which is why the scientific revolution had to have a wider context: the Enlightenment, a revolution in how people sought knowledge, trying not to rely on authority. "Take no one's word for it."
> So, for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress, seek good explanations, the ones that can't be easily varied, while still explaining the phenomena.

Note that Detsche's hard-to-vary principle is relates to more formalized principles in deep learning such as [the bias-variance trade-off](/ml/double-descent-contrary-to-bias-variance-trade-off) and Occam’s razor.

Here are quotes from **Linus Torvalds**:
> It gives people the excuse to say, 'Oh, nature was just created,' and so the act of creation is seen to be something miraculous.

Linus references the **Golden Rule** present in the New Testament (Matthew 7:12) and in a different form in the Old Testament (Leviticus 19:18).

> "There are like two golden rules in life. One is 'Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.' For some reason, people associate this with Christianity. I'm not a Christian. I'm agnostic. The other rule is 'Be proud of what you do.'


## Conjecture and Criticism in the Bible
Science progresses through conjecture and criticism if we follow **Popper**'s ideas. **David Deutsch** explained these ideas and popularized them in [The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359).

Regarding the conjectures, the bible verses promote understanding and wisdom.

We have a biblical proverb:
> The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, for the ears of the wise seek it out."

[Rockefeller was a baptist](/book/Rockefellers-Quotes-Gratitude-Fictional-Letters), and on the Rockefeller Center stands biblical quote:
> And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times


Bible proverbs often praise criticism:

> A wise man listens to advice

> Better is open rebuke


## John Calvin and Science
John Calvin's view on the sciences seems to be demonstrated in these quotes from the Institutes of the Christian Religion. They indicate that sciences are good, but not the most important:
> .. admiration of the Divine Architect. In disquisitions concerning the motions of the stars, in fixing their situations, measuring their distances, and distinguishing their peculiar properties, there is need of skill, exactness, and industry; and the **providence of God being more clearly revealed by these discoveries**, the mind ought to rise to a sublimer elevation for the contemplation of his glory.

> Therefore, since it appears that those whom the Scripture styles “natural men,” ψυχικους, have discovered such **acuteness and perspicacity in the investigation of sublunary things, let us learn from such examples**, how many good qualities the Lord has left to the nature of man, since it has been despoiled of what is truly good.

Another view on this is the idea of vocational calling ([Commentary on 1 Corintians 1:20](https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/eng/cal/1-corinthians-7.html)):

> ... that every one should be contented with his calling, and pursue it, instead of seeking to betake himself to anything else. A calling in Scripture means a lawful mode of life, for it has a relation to God as calling us...


## Capitalism and Calvinism Christianity 
Max Weber describes [Calvinism (Puritanism) in his book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism/Chapter_IV).
Max Weber argued that doctrine of predestination **placed transcendental God outside the timeline** (finitum non est capax infiniti),
the removed all mystical, magical, and ritualistic elements in **favor of wordly affairs** (labour in a calling which serves the mundane life of the community),
removed all feeling in favor of **systematic self-control and self-confidence** (God helps those who help themselves).

> On the one hand it is held to be an absolute duty to consider oneself chosen, and to **combat all doubts as temptations** of the devil, since lack of self-confidence is the result of insufficient faith, hence of imperfect grace. ...

> On the other hand, in order to **attain that self-confidence intense worldly activity** is recommended as the most suitable means. It and it alone **disperses religious doubts and gives the certainty of grace**.

Max Weber additionally argued that the faith alone doctrine removed simplistic "Good works" in favor of "**worldly calling**". This in turn he hypothesized caused increase in accumulation and **reinvestment of capital**. However, Calvinist secularized quickly **without passing their religion to their descendants**, and so over time the spirit started to disappear by the times of **Benjamin Franklin**:
> Medieval ethics not only tolerated begging but actually glorified it in the mendicant orders. Even secular beggars, since they gave the person of means opportunity for good works through giving alms, were sometimes considered an estate and treated as such. ...

> One of the fundamental elements of the spirit of modern capitalism, and not only of that but of all modern culture: **rational conduct on the basis of the idea of the calling**, was born—that is what this discussion has sought to demonstrate—from the **spirit of Christian asceticism**. One has only to re-read the passage from **(Benjamin) Franklin**, quoted at the beginning of this essay, in order to see that the essential elements of the attitude which was there called the **spirit of capitalism** are the same as what we have just shown to be the content of the **Puritan worldly asceticism**, only without the religious basis, which by Franklin's time had **died away**.

While Max Weber thesis lacked quantitative data to prove his point, there are quantitative studies on The Protestant Ethic topic, which show that in some parts of the world the Calvinism faith had effects, but not always and everywhere:
- [The Economic Effects of the Protestant Reformation Testing the Weber Hypothesis in the German Lands](http://www.davidecantoni.net/pdfs/maxweber_jeea_paper.pdf)
- [Was Weber Wrong? A Human Capital Theory of Protestant Economic History](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=988031)
- [Study: The Protestant work ethic is real. psmag.com](https://psmag.com/economics/protestant-worth-ethic-real-65544)

The last one in particular, observed in simplified terms that Protestantism may not make you rich, but makes you unhappy when you’re not rich:

> Tests the relation between Protestantism and work attitudes using a novel method, operationalizing work ethic as the effect of unemployment on individuals’ subjective well-being. Analyzing a sample of 150,000 individuals from 82 societies, we find strong support for a Protestant work ethic: unemployment hurts Protestants more and hurts more in Protestant societies. Whilst the results shed new light on the Protestant work ethic debate, the method has wider applicability in the analysis of attitudinal differences. ...

[Peter Thiel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfbndRTlsg4) criticizes that predestination's removal of free will causes removal of personal responsibility.
Too much focus on insufficiencies of people of total depravity may cause reduction of conversations.
Both causing stagnation.


### Calvinist Founding of America?

There is a common opinion that Benjamin Franklin was a deist. But based on his autobiography, I think he was briefly a deist and reverted to something between calvinism and deism:
> appear’d now not so clever a Performance as I once thought it; and I doubted whether some Error had not insinuated itself unperceiv’d, into my Argument, so as to infect all that follow’d, as is common in **metaphysical Reasonings**. I grew convinc’d that **Truth, Sincerity & Integrity in Dealings between Man & Man, were of the utmost Importance to the Felicity of Life**, and I form’d written Resolutions, ... certain Actions might not be bad because they were forbidden by it, or good because it commanded them; yet probably those Actions might be **forbidden because they were bad for us, or commanded because they were beneficial to us**, in their own Natures, all the Circumstances of things considered. And this Persuasion, with **the kind hand of Providence, or some guardian Angel, or accidental favorable Circumstances & Situations, or all together**, preserved me

Based on above, the thesis [Did America Have a Christian Founding?](https://www.heritage.org/political-process/report/did-america-have-christian-founding) may be right, that the United States were predominantly founded by Calvinists of Puritan variety.
Which however over time declined in numbers.

> between **55 percent and 75 percent** of white citizens in this era associated themselves with **Calvinist churches**, and members of the tradition were significantly overrepresented among American intellectual elites. King George himself reportedly referred to the **War for Independence as “a Presbyterian Rebellion.”**


## Criticism of Mystical Pop Cultures
Calvinist criticized all magical and mystical things, but what quantitative studies tell us about it?
There is a very unusual book [The Pragmatist’s Guide to Crafting Religion](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BSLDF2FW), which is a compilation information on cultures, religions, and traditions.
It identifies elements of soft or pop culture or soft culture beliefs: wishing thinking, crystals, wow-effect large things like universe, lacking specificity or containing unknowable.
While these seem to be similar to intuitive early religions, in wealthy societies these are associated with very low birth rates.


## Prayer from a Secular Perspective
Prayer puts locus of control externally, which is suboptimal from agency perspective, but let's look at other aspects of prayer.

Prayer may also be a watered-down problem-solving method by working backward from the end goal (e.g., Amazon), inversion of Charlie Munger, or Polya.
We can interpret it as regarding the end goal first, which helps one to create the plan:

> Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established. - Proverbs 16:3 (NIV)

Prayer can also be considered as [practicing gratitude, which has positive psychological effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude#Association_with_well-being).

> Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. - 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 (NIV)

A prayer can also be akin to meditation, which also seems to have positive psychological effects up to certain limit, when it can become unhealthy like everything.

> therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers. - 1 Peter 4:7 (ESV)

Some calls for prayers are public, and in that case it can server as an goal alignment to be acted upon later.


## The Bible's Missing Modern Words
Interesting how the Bible doesn't have words for things that hadn't been discovered at that time. For example, "heart" often seems to refer to "brain".
Notice how using the word brain in the place of word heart sometimes changes meaning of some quotes:

> have not asked for yourself long life, nor have you asked for riches for yourself, nor have you asked for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice; behold, I have done according to your word. Behold, I have given you a wise and understanding **heart**;

> Keep your **heart** with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.
 
> The **heart** of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.

> Frustration is better than laughter, because a sad face is good for the **heart**.

> The **heart** of the discerning acquires knowledge, for the ears of the wise seek it out.

Similarly, there was no word for DNA, although the concept was also intuitively partially understood. Perhaps we could look at word "image" as sometimes referring to the DNA:

> When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered a son in his own likeness, after his **image**, and named him Seth. (Genesis 5:3)

> So God created man in his own **image**, in the **image** of God he created him; (Genesis 1:27)


## Not-Not Is What? Actionable Commandments?
Here an over-extrapolation from the Ten Commandments of the Bible by flipping them from a prohibitive form into a proactive, dynamic secular form, focusing on what to do instead of what not to do.
For example, notice that the Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12, Leviticus 19:18) is also almost a positive proactive form of The Eye for an Eye law (Matthew 5:38, Leviticus 24:19). 

You will disagree with these because I cannot precisely invert negative into positive.
I also provide potentially supportive quotes from other parts of the Bible.

## Christian Themes in Anime
**Gurren Lagann**, the only anime I could watch, kept me thinking after finishing it. Some parts seemed familiar. Then, I realized that the series' main themes have Christian analogs. The spiral energy is similar to the Holy Spirit; Kamina plays the role of Christ, and the LorgGenome is the Father. Kamina recommends to instead of trying to believe in yourself, to instead [believe in God (him - Kamina), that believes in you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC6wdfk2M98) (Similar to but not the same - John 12:46, John 15:5, 1 Peter 5:7 and other similar passages: Isaiah 41:10, Proverbs 3:6). He has sayings similar to "All things are possible for one who believes." (Mark 9:23 ESV) Kamina also comes back from the dead once more at the end of the show. The team eventually forms a large body, "Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann," similar to the body of the Church of the bible. You can find more similarities in [this link](https://www.iklone.org/post/christianity-in-gurren-lagann). Christianity permeates today's culture in unexpected places worldwide.

There is also [a bible quote in Ghost in Shell](https://youtu.be/Y8fuP8VFm_I?si=faw2U5friB8kN7W3).

> when I was a child, my speech, feelings, and thinking were all those of a child. Now that I am a man, I have no more use for childish ways. - 1 Corinthians 13:11 (Ghost in The Shell translation)


## Two Usual Philosophers of 1800s
The ninth commandment of not being a false witness contributed to systematic inquiry into science. Scientific inquiry multiplied, aggregated, and executed knowledge. However, the knowledge snapped back and came to be perceived as superseding or disagreeing with parts of the scriptures.

Yet a small light remained after the storm. Perhaps the implicit positive form of commandments pointed upward—towards growth. Also, can we look at the Tower of Babel story as less against ambition and technology and more about preferring diversity of solutions?

> You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works. (Matthew 5:13)

The 1800s was a rapid development period. There were 2 highly usual writers in the 1800s: Friedrich Nietzsche, and William Winwood Reade.


### Friedrich Nietzsche
**Friedrich Nietzsche** (1844 - 1900) I read long ago. Reflecting now on him, I think it is not positive despite some qualities. His writing is uplifting at times, but overthinking and living in his head. He had this idea of Eternal return. This cyclical universe, which is interesting idea in the context of astrophysics. For him, it was a motivator - the "heaviest burden" of being forced to repeat the same life. This motivator does not suggest a wish to improve the world. In the end, was he a nihilist, which he wanted to prevent? A mystic who was turning back the clock with Eternal return and with partial reversion to the Roman belief system?

> “It is an easy thing for the shadow to lengthen ten steps. Rather let the shadow go back ten steps.” And Isaiah the prophet called to the Lord, and he brought the shadow back ten steps, by which it had gone down on the steps of Ahaz. (2 Kings 20:9 ESV)

Nietzsche was over-focused on the individual and individual progress instead of understanding and contributing to society that would catalyze such progress. That seems to me caused him to misunderstand the collective upside of specific religions or morals that grew in the times between Ancient Greece and his life. This lead him to relativism.

I think Nietzsche was, for example, wrong in that [Socrates did not think of life as a sickness, instead Socrates he wanted to offer to a god of medicine and healing](http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie/vol10/Jesus.html). Probably due a bad translation or too much imagination.

Nietzsche wished to elevate human, but his vision was too much about a singular relativistic man lost high in the mountains like his Zarathustra. His writing seems often emotional. Still, there are some redeeming parts, and he probably suffered the poorer health than Reade.


### William Winwood Reade
**William Winwood Reade** (1838 - 1875), a different man - a pragmatist. He traveled much more, wrote more about human societies, history, and did more natural research than Nietzsche. Some passages of his work are controversial similar to Nietzsche's works. But the overall philosophical direction seem more interesting and more positive: to find minimum viable beliefs making them harder-to-vary (see notes on Deutsch above). Consequently, finding beliefs that do not conflict with new knowledge and keep the divine spark.

He wished to incorporate the sciences and good works:

> we wish him to have a religion which will harmonise with his intellect, and which inquiry will strengthen (The Martyrdom Of Man)

> Those who desire to worship their Creator must worship him through mankind. (The Martyrdom Of Man)

> There are passionate desires of virtue, yearnings for the good, which descend from time to time like a holy spirit upon all cultivated minds, and from which, strange as it may seem, not even free-thinkers are excluded. When such an impulse animates the godless man he expends it in the service of mankind;(The Martyrdom Of Man)

He thought there were no Ghosts in our shells:

> There is no such thing as a ghost or soul; the intellects of men resemble those instincts which inhabit the corpuscules, and which are dispersed when the corpuscule dies. (The Martyrdom Of Man)

He seemed to be similar kind of semi-Deist like Benjamin Franklin:

> One to whom it is profanity to pray, of whom it is idle and irreverent to argue and debate, of whom we should never presume to think save with humility and awe; that Unknown God has ordained that mankind should be elevated by misfortune, and that happiness should grow out of misery and pain. (The Martyrdom Of Man)

He also writes about scientific development.

> And then, the earth being small, mankind will migrate into space, and will cross the airless Saharas which separate planet from planet, and sun from sun. 

> Finally, men will master the forces of Nature; they will become themselves architects of systems, manufacturers of worlds.

I may be wrong. Let me know if that is so. I only listened to the audiobook, read things elsewhere, and re-read some-parts of the book. Perhaps I will write later. I need to return to earthly matters.

> He who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap. (Ecclesiastes 11:4-6 ESV)

I hope [this writing is good for something (Civilization 6)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOT9T15mkX0).


## The End is The New Beginning
How does your philosophy shape your life?
I hope you became more by brainstorming today with me.

Where do go from here?
