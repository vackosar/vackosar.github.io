Flite in comparison to Festival has

* pleasant voices
* samely comprehensible voices
* big problems when combination with ffmpeg streaming encoding over bash pipes (This is why I don't use it for [audiobook generation](https://vackosar.github.io/2016/07/11/Audiobook-Generation.html).)
* designed for embedded devices ([see docs](http://www.festvox.org/flite/) )
