[Flite](http://www.festvox.org/flite/) in comparison to [Festival](http://www.festvox.org/festival/) has:

- - pleasant voices
- - samely comprehensible voices
- - big problems when combination with ffmpeg streaming encoding over bash pipes (This is why I don't use it for [audiobook generation](https://vackosar.github.io/2016/07/11/Audiobook-Generation.html).)
- - designed for embedded devices ([see docs](http://www.festvox.org/flite/) )
