The disassembly is fairly easy as I was able to repaste and install LTE antenna without any previous experience, that is except removing LCD panel, which seems to be just glued onto the cover in a cheapskate manner.
Concern is durability of screws on your machine as they can take only so much use before need for replacement. Some of my screws are at 60% mileage after 8-10 openings.

I recommend using the maintenance manual combined with a video linked in the corresponding sections below.
Read my [review of P52 based on personal experience, P52 vs ZBook G5 comparison](/electronics/Thinkpad-P52-vs-HP-Zbook-15-G5-vs-Dell-Precision-7530).

I personally did full disassembly due to having to clean up almond butter from all over the fans.


## Download Manual
The non-official download is much faster

- [Official download](https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles_pdf/tp_p52_hmm_en.pdf)


## Chassis Disassebly
I recommend using the amateur video below, but I am linking to official videos as well.

## LCD Panel Removal - Not achieved
    
There is a video on Youtube on P51 LCD removal, but it does not apply to P52. P52 has screen glued with double-sided tape, due to which I was not able to remove the screen, forcing me to install LTE antenna in a hacky way.


What I also love about P52 is graphics card, I can [train neural networks like 2-layer DistilBERT](/ml/transformers-self-attention-mechanism-simplified) on my local machine.
