The disassembly is fairly as I was able to repaste and install LTE antenna without any previous experience, that is except ability to remove LCD panel, which seems to be just glued in a cheapskate manner.
Concern is durability of screws on your machine as they can take only so much use before need for replacement. Some of my screws are at 60% mileage after 8-10 openings.

I recommend using the manual combined with a video linked in the corresponding sections. You can find [P52 vs ZBook G5 comparison](/2019/03/03/Thinkpad-P52-vs-HP-Zbook-15-G5-vs-Dell-Precision-7530.html) on this site as well.

## LCD Panel Removal - Not achieved
    
There is a video on Youtube on P51 LCD removal, but it does not apply to P52. P52 has screen glued with double-sided tape, due to which I was not able to remove the screen, forcing me to install LTE antenna in a hacky way.
