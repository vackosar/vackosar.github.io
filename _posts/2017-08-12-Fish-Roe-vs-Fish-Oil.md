# Abstract

Fish oil is popular supplement. It's production was optimized for maximum content of popular fatty acids DHA and EPA. Fish roe is food of salty taste produced from egg masses of fish known to be good source of omega-3 fatty acids. With this article I am trying to compare the two in terms of price and health improvement.   

# EPA Gram Price Comparison

EPA estimates are based on fatty acid composition and referenced studies and package fat contents. Content estimates are per common container size of 50g.

|Fish    |Fat Content (g)|Estimated EPA Content (g)|Price ($)|$/g EPA|
|--------|---------------|-------------------------|---------|-------|
|Salmon  |5              |0.85                     |8.3      |9.76   |
|Lumpfish|1.75           |0.34                     |3.6      |10.58  |
|Capelin |1.95           |0.37                     |1.5      |4.05   |
|Herring |0.75 ?         |0.08 ?                   |1.5      |18.75 ?|

For comparison, Now Foods Omega-3, 180 EPA/120 DHA, 200 Softgels:
- Serving of 2 capsules contains EPA grams: 0.36
- $/g EPA: 0.18

_Thus fish oil EPA is 22 times cheaper per gram._

# Perishability

I expect that thanks to refrigeration and natural encapsulation of fish roe, that it will arrive to you in much higher quality than fish oil. Anecdotally, I usually don't feel well after fish oil serving, which may be caused by perished product. 
  
# Other Contents

I haven't looked into this, but I suspect that fish roe will contain more diverse and higher quality content.

# Conclusion

While fish oil EPA is more than 20 times cheaper, I cannot rule out fish roe as potentially superior in terms of health improvement.
