This recipe produces 5 simple meals in 35 minutes.

I don't like restaurant foods and I don't feel well after eating them due to histamine content, 
so I developed following recipe over the years.
Some ingredients are accidentally inline with Bryan Johnsons recipes, but some things I got inspired from him.

- Prepare your large pressure cooking pot, e.g., from IKEA.
- Soak 500g of black beans (or red beans) for 8 hours, e.g., overnight. Wash beans afterward. The beans should absorb the water and be a bit softer.
- Then pressure-cook the beans but add:
  - frozen chicken breast
  - salt, 1g oregano, 1g potassium chloride salt.
- Increase the pressure fast within 5 minutes. Then cook for 30 minutes in high pressure. The frozen breast should be done well. The beans should be soft and edible.
- In parallel cook:
	- 150g of quinoa (good protein spectrum) or semolina high fibre pasta cooked for 15 minutes. I prefer to under-cook to have less sugar.
	- 300g of frozen mixed vegetables of cauliflower, brocolli, carrot, pepper to reduce the fibers a bit. Add 100g almonds. Cooked for 10 minutes.
- Then mix into the large pressure-cooking pot:
- Add following:
  - creatine
  - [psyllium](/health/cooking-with-psyllium-fiber-to-reduce-suger-spikes) 5x tea spoon
  - 5 teaspoons of blueberries or redcurrant
- (Optional) Add selected from these:
	- pea sprouts for DAO enzyme.
	- carob for flavonoids and polyphenols as a cacao alternative.
	- 6x1 brazil nut, or macadamia
	- carrot, bell peppers, parsley
	- goat whey protein 5x 30g (this is hard to get. only the AlpenPower is good enough)
- Split portions into containers, cool and freeze them within 1 hour for later use.
- I eat 1 meal for breakfast and 1 for lunch.

I add photos later.
