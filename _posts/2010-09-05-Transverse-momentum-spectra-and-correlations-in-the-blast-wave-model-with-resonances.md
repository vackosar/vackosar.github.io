### Abstract
This thesis provides a review about the basics of theories of properties of matter with high energy density, which originates in heavy ion high energy collisions ( GeV/nucleus). Basic information about the extreme state of matter called quark-gluon  plasma,  introduction  to  quantum  statistical  mechanics  and  introduction  to theory of longitudinally boost-invariantly expanding fireball of hot matter are mentioned.

Particular intention is given to the blast-wave model with resonances, whose basic assumptions are longitudinally boost-invariant expansion, transverse expansion, and the existence of a particular hypersurface in space-time, on which hadronic matter abruptly decouples from fireball.

In the final part two most important parameters of the blast-wave model are extracted from fits to the transverse momentum spectra obtained from STAR experiment, using a modification of the program DRAGON [B. Tomasik, Comp.Phys.Commun.
