### Abstract
This work provides a review of theories of properties of high energy density matter originating in heavy-ion high energy collisions (GeV/nucleus). 
The work contains an introduction to the extreme state of matter called quark-gluon plasma, quantum statistical mechanics, and theory of longitudinally boost-invariantly expanding fireball of a hot matter. 

Particular intention is given to the blast-wave model with resonances, whose basic assumptions are longitudinally boost-invariant expansion, transverse expansion, and the existence of a particular hypersurface in space-time, on which hadronic matter abruptly decouples from fireball.

In the final part two most important parameters of the blast-wave model are extracted from fits to the transverse momentum spectra obtained from STAR experiment, using a modification of the program DRAGON [B. Tomasik, Comp.Phys.Commun.
