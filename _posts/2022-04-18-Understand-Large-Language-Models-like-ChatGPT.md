The presentation explains the development of **large language models like ChatGPT**, which can generate text by predicting input text continuation. The idea of a talking machine has been around since the 1700s, but it wasn't until the development of **powerful computers and computer science** that it became a reality. Simple document representations, such as **counting word occurrences**, were used to create [sparse matrices](/ml/sparse-matrix-why-and-when) as feature vectors in methods like **term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency and latent semantic analysis**. Non-contextual word vectors were created using **word2vec**, which trained embeddings to sum up close to the middle word vector. Later, **contextual word vectors** were created using [transformer architecture](/ml/transformers-self-attention-mechanism-simplified), which consumes the entire input sequence and is state-of-the-art in 2022.



## Dream of a Talking Machine
- Idea of a talking machine since 1700s, but weak computers and computer science
- ChatGPT does almost what was predicted, but how?
- How to instruct large language model to perform tasks?
- How represent knowledge in computers?
- How to generate the answers?

## Text Prompt as an Interface
- For example 2001: A Space Odyssey HAL 9000
- input textual instructions e.g. explain a riddle
- based on its knowledge computer generates the answer text

## Large Language Models
- generate by predicting input text continuation
- $10M transformers trained on large amount of text from the internet in 2022
- can solve wide variety of problems like explaining jokes, sometimes with human level performance
- examples: [PaLM (2022)](/ml/googles-pathways-language-model-and-chain-of-thought), [RETRO (2021)](/ml/DeepMinds-RETRO-Transformer-Model), [hybrids with algorithms](/ml/Symbolic-vs-Connectionist-Machine-Learning)
- ChatGPT additionally trained to chat using [RLHF alignment method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01325)

## Future: Hybridizing Text with Algorithms
- ChatGPT and other Large Language Models hallucinate despite alignment with [RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01325)
- If neural network has a intuition, what is repetition, search, self-reflection?
- Read more about [reasoning without hallucinations hybridizing neural networks with code](/ml/Symbolic-vs-Connectionist-Machine-Learning)
- Also: [understanding image and text regardless of a language](/ml/Multimodal-Image-Text-Classification)

## Instructing ChatGPT and Large Language Models
- [Prompting is asking the LLMs right questions](/ml/Prompting-Techniques-That-Sqeeze-The-Best-Out-of-Your-LLM)
- [Common prompting techniques](/ml/Prompting-Techniques-That-Sqeeze-The-Best-Out-of-Your-LLM): being specific, provide examples, allow thinking step by step, self-reflecting
- Use cases: question answering, coding, form filling, data schema extraction, knowledge graph construction
