I created [3 day prediction chart of Coronavirus infected and dead](https://coronaviruschart.com/) with optional logarithmic scale.

**UPDATE**

I recently also added [interactive comparison of countries infected and dead](https://www.coronaviruschart.com/#compareCountriesHead), that is updated every day from Hopkins COVID-19 data.
