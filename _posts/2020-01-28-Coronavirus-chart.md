title: "Coronavirus Chart - The First 3 Day Prediction Of C19"
date: 2020-01-28
description: Early into the pandemic I created simple chart tracking covid-19 infections and deaths to inform.
---

I created [3 day prediction chart of Coronavirus infected and dead](https://coronaviruschart.com/) with optional logarithmic scale.
It is simplistic geometric progression predictor, which becomes in acurrate later into the pandemic.
I topped 84k unique visits in March. I didn't have free time to dedicate to the page, so I was overtaken after some time.

One of the more unique features is ability to compare countries: [interactive comparison of countries infected and dead](https://www.coronaviruschart.com/#compareCountriesHead).

The data is updated every day from Hopkins COVID-19 data.
