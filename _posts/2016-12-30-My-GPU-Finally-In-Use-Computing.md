I scarcely play any games on my otherwise quite fast desktop. Now, I am finally heating up that GTX 960!

I am not gaming though. I rather started playing with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) - a library for numerical computations.
I focus now on machine learning using neural networks. So far I played with:
