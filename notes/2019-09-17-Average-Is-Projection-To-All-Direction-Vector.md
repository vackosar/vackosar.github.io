title: "Average Is Projection To All-Direction Vector"

# TODO

There is a geometric interpretation for average (mean) that will be shown below. The interpretation is analogous to geometric interpretation of covariance, which can be [easily seen as dot product of two vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance#Definition). The dimensions of the vectors are data points of the distributions.

A kin to covariance from below one can see that average is a projection to normalized all-direction vector.
