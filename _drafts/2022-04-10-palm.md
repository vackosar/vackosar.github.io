## Summary
- 540-billion parameters
- 2x bigger than GPT-3 175B
- 2x smaller than [Switch Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03961.pdf) 1T
  - only parts of the model is activated at each time.
- but the most expensive model trained ~$10M
- human brain 100T connections

- highly efficient training on 6144 TPU v4 chips across multiple cluster TPU Pods
- breakthrough performance without fine-tuning
- breakthrough performance outperforming average human on BIG-bench benchmark

## Dataset
- 780 billion tokens of high-quality text


## Efficient Scaling
- pipeline-free allows bigger scale
