by his contrivance, the most ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour, might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.
... He then commanded six-and-thirty of the lads, to read the several lines softly, as they appeared upon the frame; and where they found three or four words together that might make part of a sentence

## Prompt as an Interface
- input textual instructions
- computer generates output based on its knowledge

## How To Represent Knowledge
- textual documents in a database
- counting word occurrences on documents level into [sparce matrices](/ml/sparse-matrix-why-and-when)
- methods: TF*IDF, Latent semantic analysis
- search by list of words (query) ~1970s
- in ~1995 page rank counting links between documents

## Non-Contextual Words Vectors
- non-contextual word vectors

- contextual word vectors
- knowledge graph
