Llama 70b Instruct is definitely not as good in complext instruction following as GPT-4-Turbo based on my manual tests.
This may be due to weaker fine-tuning, which can still be improved.

Also function calling support is missing and it would be an advancement.

## Llama 3 Performance

Llama 3 70b gained impressive 81.9 on HumanEval O-shot.
