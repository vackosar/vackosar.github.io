I love audiobooks, because they can utilize brain-time, which would otherwise be lost e.g. time when walking, running or hiking. Problem of audiobooks however is their scarcity, which I always struggled with especially in case of technical books.

Guess what? I've finally put together [a simplistic tool for generating audiobooks from plain text](https://github.com/vackosar/text2gsm) that works! I call it [text2gsm](https://github.com/vackosar/text2gsm) as it converts plain text file into GSM WAV compression format optimal for voice.

So next time I want to read book, but have no time to do it, I'll generate myself a audiobook and listen to it during otherwise lost time. Neat!
