An acoustic world map is a pretty stealthy and cheap solution as the panels are only visible from the sides. I used double-sided adhesive tape to attach the light and thin panels. The foam is "acoustic molitan CME3535" from the Hornbach DIY store costing about $20, so it is probably not super high quality.

My goal was to reduce echos, ambient noises, and improve quality of voice calls and recordings of an experimental podcast [Reading Papers](https://youtu.be/-khooNLxuII).

So I finally got to improving my apartment acoustics. Step by step as usual - not starting too dramatic. The panel foam quality is probably deficient, though.
