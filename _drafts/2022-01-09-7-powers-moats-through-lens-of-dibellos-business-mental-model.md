The [Helmer's 7 Powers book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32816087-7-powers) lists 7 barriers that protect margins of businesses long term and how to attain them.
[DiBello's research](https://wtri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Informed-By-Knowledge-Chapter-12.pdf) suggests that great business people understand interaction between following three aspects (dimensions) of a business: demand, supply, capital.
The text below may provide additional insights into both through partial modification, followed by combination of the ideas above.
For example, Helmer's book does not list capital side of the described moats and network effects between suppliers and investors, but idea-fusion hints that they may exist.

_I have partially restated and aligned some of the concepts from the references to offer interesting view, so be aware._
_Additionally, this is my initial version of the post on this topic._

## DiBello Mental Model Dimensions
DiBello's research suggests that there is a triad of crucial aspects of a business that great business people understand.
Here I restate modified DiBello's dimensions of mental model of business, adding units, agents, and related terms.
For details, I recommend reading [Mental Model of Business](https://commoncog.com/blog/business-mental-model/)

Note that many terms in business cannot fall on the single dimension listed below.
The point of a business is in fact to function across the dimensions to create value.

- Demand (market, market trends, competitive analysis, positioning, "strategy")
	- unit = deal, sale, brand asset, ...
	- agents = customers, marketing agencies, marketers, CMO, Business Development, users, ...
	- terms: competition, prospect, cost of goods sold, return on ads spend, ...
- Supply (manufacturing, production, product development, operations, "leadership")
	- unit = product, service, productive asset (machine), ...
	- agents = suppliers, builders, CTO, procurement, cloud providers, ...
	- terms: design, blueprints, cost of production, ...
- Capital (finance, economic climate)
	- unit = money, financial assets, ...
	- agents = investors, bondholders, accountants, CFO, ...
	- terms: cashflow, debt, equity receivables, cost of capital ...

Certain terms are sometimes assigned by DiBello into other dimensions than as in above e.g. cost of goods sold is instead listed under the Capital dimension.
In those cases, I differ as it seems more useful to assign elsewhere.
For example, DiBello would probably place suppliers into the Demand, while I list them in Supply.
There may be no suppliers, or they may be indistinguishable from customers in some cases.
Dimension agnostic (cross-cutting) terms and agents are: CEO, technology, operations, human resources, management, security, software, R&D, execution, planning.
These exist or take action in two or more dimensions.

## 7 Powers From Perspective of DiBello's 
Helmer's book defines Power as "the set of conditions creating the potential for persistent differential returns".
It is about building defensive moat, or a barrier to protect margins from competitive arbitrage.
For a summary I recommend reading [7 Powers summary](https://commoncog.com/blog/7-powers-summary/).
Below I offer a view of the powers through the lens of DiBello's model.
I split them according to company stage to which they become accessible.


### Startup Stage Powers
- Counter-positioning - Where big players cannot follow?
	- benefited dimensions: supply, demand, capital
	- barrier: big players optimized in local maximum with lots of trust cannot follow 
	- examples: specialized production, niche market, business model
- Cornered-Resource - What can you own exclusively almost all of?
	- benefited dimensions: supply, demand, capital
	- barrier: external force of contracts, laws
	- examples: exclusive contract, patent, regulation, property, employee, exclusive funding
	
### Scaleup Stage Powers
- Switching costs - Why customers, suppliers, investors cannot switch to competition cheaply?
    - benefited dimensions: supply, demand, capital
    - barrier: competitor has to pay switching costs
    - examples: deep integration with systems, data and configuration stored in the systems, habits
- Scale - How to pay fixed-cost or network the agents?
	- Scale Economies (Supply side-scale) - production fixed-costs or networking suppliers
		- benefited dimensions: supply
		- barrier: market share
		- examples: shooting movies to distribute across subscribers ([Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix))
	- Demand-side Scale Economy (Network) - Demand fixed-costs or networking customers
		- benefited dimensions: demand
		- barrier: market share
		- examples: social networks (Facebook), marketing fixed-costs ([Red Bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull)), recommender systems, Google ranking
	- Capital Economies - Capital fixed-costs or networking investors
        - benefited dimensions: capital
        - barrier: market share
        - examples:
          - IPO has high fixed-costs of regulatory reporting
          - Investor network effects perhaps exist as [reflexivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory)#In_economics) (the more people want the Mona Lisa the higher it is priced)
		
### Corp-up Stage Powers
- Hysteresis (optimization, trust, stability)
	- Process Power - What creates non-replicable and stable organizational capability?
		- benefited dimensions: supply
		- lower costs per unit of supply due to optimization and trust of suppliers
		- barrier: time in production
	- Branding - What accrues trust and nostalgia with users and markets optimally?
		- benefited dimension: demand
		- lower costs per unit of demand due to optimization and trust of customers
		- barrier: time in market
	- Lindy Effect - What accrues trust and optimizes capital operations?
		- benefited dimension: capital
		- low cost of capital thanks to optimization and trust of investors
		- example: Blue chip stocks
