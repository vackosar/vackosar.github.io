The [Helmer's 7 Powers book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32816087-7-powers) lists 7 barriers that protect margins of businesses and how to attain them. [DiBello's research](https://wtri.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Informed-By-Knowledge-Chapter-12.pdf) suggests that great business people understand all three partially independent aspects or dimensions of business: demand, supply, capital. The text below may provide you additional insights into both through combination of the ideas above. For example, Helmer's book seems to miss capital side of the described moats that the perpective below naturally brings out.

I have partially restated and aligned some of the concepts in contrast to the references to offer interesting view, so be aware. Also this is my initial version of the post on this topic.

## DiBello Mental Model Dimensions
DiBello's research suggests that there is a triad of crucial aspects of a business that great business people understand. Here I restate modified DiBello's dimensions of mental model of business. For details I recommend reading [Mental Model of Business](https://commoncog.com/blog/business-mental-model/)

- Demand (market, market trends, competitive analysis, positioning, "strategy")
	- unit = deal, sale, brand assets
	- agents = customers, marketing agencies, marketers, CMO, Business Development
	- terms: competition, prospect, cost of goods sold, return on ads spend, ...
- Supply (manufacturing, production, product development, operations, "leadership")
	- unit = product, service, productive assets
	- agents = suppliers, employees, CTO, procurement
	- terms: cost of production, design, ...
- Capital (finance, economic climate)
	- unit = money, financial assets
	- agents = investors, bond holders, accounters, CFO
	- terms: cashflow, debt, equity receivables, cost of capital ...
	
Dimension agnostic (cross-cutting) terms:
- technology, operations, human resources, management, security, software developement, R&D, execution, planning
- In some cases these terms are sometimes assigned by DiBello into one of the dimensions above. 

## 7 Powers From Perspective of DiBello's 
Helmer's book defines Power as "the set of conditions creating the potential for persistent differential returns".  It is about building defensive moat, or a barrier to protect margins from competitive arbitrage. For a summary I recommend reading [7 Powers summary](https://commoncog.com/blog/7-powers-summary/).
Below I offer a view of the powers through the lens of DiBello's model.

### Startup Stage Powers
- Counter-positioning - Where big players cannot follow?
	- benefited dimensions: supply, demand, capital
	- barrier: big players in local maximum and cannot follow 
	- examples: specialized production, nieche market, business model
	- attack: build your own separate copy
- Cornered-Resource - What can you own exlusively almost all of?
	- benefited dimensions: supply, demand, capital
	- barrier: external force of contracts, laws
	- examples: exclusive contract, patent, regulation, property laws, employees, exclusive funding
	- inverse: anti-trust
	
### Scaleup Stage Powers
- Switching costs - Why customers, suppliers, investors cannot switch to competition cheaply?
	- benefited dimensions: supply, demand, capital
	- barrier: competitor has to pay switching costs
	- examples: data and configuration stored in the systems, habits
	- inverse: cheap migration
- Scale - How to pay fixed cost or network the agents?
	- Scale Economies (Supply side-scale) - production fixed costs and networking suppliers
		- benefited dimensions: supply
		- barrier: market share
		- examples: shooting movies to distribute across subscribers
	- Network Economies - Demand fixed costs and networking customers
		- benefited dimensions: demand (demand-side economy of scale)
		- barrier: market share
		- examples: social networks, marketing fixed costs, recommender systems, google ranking
	- Capital Economies - Capital fixed costs and networking investors
		- benfit: fixed costs of increased reporting to get access to cheaper capital
		- barrier: market share
		- examples: IPO has fixed costs of regulatory reporting, reflexivity (investor network effects)
		
### Corp-up Stage Powers
- Hysteresis (optimizing, trust, reputation):
	- Process Power - What creates non-replicable or tacit organizational capability?
		- benefited dimensions: supply
		- lower costs per unit of supply due to optimization and trust of suppliers
		- barrier: time in production
	- Branding - What accrues trust, safety, and nostalgia with users?
		- benefited dimension: demand
		- lower costs per unit of demand due to optimization and trust of customers
		- barrier: time in market
	- Lindy Effect
		- benefited dimension: capital
		- low cost of capital thanks to optimization and trust of investors
		- example: Blue chip stocks
